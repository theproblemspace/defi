## Capital Inefficiency: DeFi Loans Require Overcollateralization

In a trustless environment, it’s difficult to verify who a person is, let alone collect on an unpaid loan.

Rather than building a way of identifying wallets and mitigating risk for lenders, DeFi protocols usually demand overcollateralized loans, i.e. putting aside more capital than borrowed. At best, this is a stopgap solution. It means only borrowers who hold large amounts of capital can borrow from DeFi lending protocols, that loans can’t be priced according to a borrower’s risk of default, and that various forms of unsecured lending such as commercial credit are risky or impossible using DeFi protocols.
