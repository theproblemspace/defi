# MEV

The problem that arises with MEV (Miner Extractable Value) lies in its potential to introduce unfairness, inefficiency, and security risks within blockchain networks. MEV enables miners to manipulate transaction ordering for their own gain, leading to issues such as front-running, market manipulation, and centralization. This can adversely impact user experience, hinder market integrity, and raise regulatory concerns. Additionally, MEV activities may distort economic incentives within decentralized systems, diverting resources away from productive activities and undermining the principles of transparency and fairness that underpin blockchain technology. Addressing the challenges associated with MEV is crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness, stability, and long-term viability of decentralized networks.

## Front-running

Miners can exploit their knowledge of pending transactions to front-run trades, taking advantage of price movements to profit at the expense of other users.

## Lack of Transparency

MEV activities often occur off-chain or in a non-transparent manner, making it difficult for users to assess the fairness and efficiency of the underlying blockchain ecosystem.

## Economic Inefficiency

MEV extraction can lead to economic inefficiencies within decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, as resources are diverted towards capturing value through MEV rather than contributing to productive activities.
