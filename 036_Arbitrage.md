# Arbitrage

## Latency arbitrage

## Cross Exchange arbitrage

## Triangular Arbitrage

Triangular arbitrage is a trading strategy that exploits pricing inefficiencies between three crypto assets, whether using multiple exchanges or a single one. It is important to note that triangular arbitrage between assets A, B, and C is only possible when the amount received after swapping each pair in succession is greater than that obtained after swapping asset A to asset C.

## Statistical Arbitrage

This method involves using a combination of econometric, statistical, and computational techniques to carry out arbitrage trades on a large scale. Traders employing this method depend on mathematical models and trading bots to execute high-frequency arbitrage trades and maximize profits.

## Cross-domain Arbitrage

Cross-domain arbitrage is currently one of the most popular types of arbitrage. This type is closely connected to the concept of MEV (Maximal Extractable Value; learn more about it in this post) and involves the manipulation of the order of transaction validation by traders who work as validators to maximize their profits when trading across different domains. These domains could include blockchains, Layer-2 networks, side-chains, centralized exchanges, and more.
