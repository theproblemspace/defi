## Privacy

Privacy is also a major issue with on-chain transactions. Transactions sitting in a mempool are vulnerable to attacks like frontrunning, where bots scour Ethereum blocks for profitable transactions and then bribe their way into the queue before them to snipe the trades. Transaction tumblers like TornadoCash can obscure the identity of parties transacting on a DeFi application, but additional gas prices and the time and technical complexity to execute these transactions can make them difficult for casual users or small transactions.

A better option being explored involves zero-knowledge proofs, which, combined with “roll-ups” allow multiple transactions to be wound up in a single, public, blockchain transaction.
